when thinking about app architecture, containers vs components, important to consider what components will get what props/dispatchers
components that get similar props/dispatchers shopuld be grouped together under common container

with react boilerplate substates are only available if their corresponding containers are mounted
use a dedicated container that's always mounted for data you want to always be available (auth flag)

ability to search within search as a UX talking point
